## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
Silverpeas Core 6.3.1 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. An attacker with low privileges is able to execute the administrator-only function of putting the application in "Maintenance Mode" due to broken access control. This makes the application unavailable to all users. 

### Usage/Exploitation
After logging in as a low privileged user, go to this URL http://localhost:8080/silverpeas/RjobStartPagePeas/jsp/ActivateMaintenance?allIntranet=1. This places the application in "Maintenance Mode" and makes it unavailable to all users.
